        <b>Data Cleaning and Preparation</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          Data of all 340 sales from 2024 was manually entered into an Excel spreadsheet through a custom data validation system.
          <br><br>
          Then the data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency across categories such as item type, date of sale, source of inventory and profit. This ensured the dataset was accurate, complete, consistent, and ready for analysis.
