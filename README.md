        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          The goal of this data is to offer insights that assist educators, policymakers, and researchers in understanding student population trends across Washington State, enabling 
          data-driven decision-making.
         <br><br> Insights from the data can support the development of targeted educational strategies, such as resource allocation for underrepresented groups, district-level 
          planning, and policies that address racial disparities in enrollment over time.
